          <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Virginia pursuing the Artificial Intelligence Focal Path,
            minoring in Applied Mathematics and Data Science. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve 
            real-world problems and creating innovative solutions.

            I'm fascinated by how mathematical models and algorithms can be used for prediction and analysis. I am interested 
            in making AI and machine learning systems both powerful and fair, working to reduce biases and ensure accuracy. 
            I'm also interested in how AI can optimize processes to make systems more efficient and effective.

            My journey in tech has been diverse from developing Power BI dashboards at Deloitte to 
            leading a 145+ member SHPE chapter. I've had the privilege of being recognized as a 
            Hispanic Scholarship Fund STEM Scholar, Code2040 Fellow, and UVA McIntire Finance Academy participant.

            Beyond coding, I'm trilingual (English, Spanish, and Quechua) and committed to supporting underrepresented communities in STEM. 
            Whether I'm debugging code, leading team initiatives, or mentoring peers, I'm driven by a desire to make technology more accessible 
            and impactful. I believe in using data for good while respecting user privacy, and I'm always eager to learn from professionals and
            collaborate on innovative projects. Outside of academics and work, I enjoy woodworking, photography, and thrifting.
