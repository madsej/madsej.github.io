          <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Virginia with a 3.74 GPA, minoring in 
            Applied Mathematics and Data Science. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve 
            real-world problems and creating innovative solutions.

          <p>
            My journey in tech has been diverse—from developing Power BI dashboards at Deloitte to 
            leading a 145+ member SHPE chapter. I've had the privilege of being recognized as a 
            Hispanic Scholarship Fund STEM Scholar, Code2040 Fellow, and UVA McIntire Finance Academy participant.

            Beyond coding, I'm trilingual (English, Spanish, and Quechua) and deeply committed to 
            supporting underrepresented communities in STEM. Whether I'm debugging code, leading 
            team initiatives, or mentoring peers, I'm driven by a desire to make technology more 
            accessible and impactful for everyone.
